When you first said it was over<br/>
Yeah it all went black<br/>
Didn't get any closure<br/>
Like a heart attack<br/>
But then you came back with flowers<br/>
Explaining for hours<br/>
How you intend on winning me back<br/>
How could I have known<br/>
You were still half detached<br/>

And I hoped things would change<br/>

But I know where you were last night<br/>
Yeah I know what you did last night<br/>
I can smell her all over your t-shirt<br/>
Pull the knife straight out of my back<br/>
Next time do a better job to cover up your tracks<br/>
I can smell her all over your t-shirt<br/>
I bet you didn't think<br/>
I'd be strong enough to leave you<br/>

I'm all for second chances<br/>
But I'm not that dumb<br/>
You love to take advantage<br/>
And it always stung<br/>
But I'm not afraid to say that I'm pulling away<br/>
Cause I'm done biting my tongue<br/>
You wanna try and have it all<br/>
Then brace for the fall<br/>

I hoped things would change<br/>

But I know where you were last night<br/>
Yeah I know what you did last night<br/>
I can smell her all over your t-shirt<br/>
Pull the knife straight out of my back<br/>
Next time do a better job to cover up your tracks<br/>
I can smell her all over your t-shirt<br/>
I bet you didnâ€™t think<br/>
I'd be strong enough to leave you<br/>

I know where you were last night<br/>
Yeah I know what you did last night<br/>

One day, I'll be friends with her<br/>
One day, yeah I'll comfort her<br/>
Cause one day, you're gonna break her heart<br/>
Cause you love breaking hearts, making scars<br/>

I know where you were last night<br/>
Yeah I know what you did last night<br/>
I can smell her all over your t-shirt<br/>
Pull the knife straight out of my back<br/>
Next time do a better job to cover up your tracks<br/>
I can smell her all over your t-shirt<br/>
I bet you didn't think<br/>
I'd be strong enough to leave you<br/>
