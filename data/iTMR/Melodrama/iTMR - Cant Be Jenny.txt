Jenny’s the type of girl you'd look up to<br/>
Jenny’s life always seems to be full of the best moves<br/>
People back home don’t get why she left 'em<br/>
But she don't look back she done forget 'em<br/>
'Cause they don't get that she's just a person<br/>
They didn't see her they saw through her blessings<br/>
<br/>
4.0 on her GPA<br/>
Ivy league on her resume<br/>
Everybody knows she's got what it takes<br/>
But even she deserves a break<br/>

Her dad is proud to say Jenny's his daughter<br/>
But he's so ashamed of her habits that he doesn't call her<br/>

Then one day she took control of her life<br/>
To the righteous their own that's what he should live out<br/>
If only he could see that it doesn't matter that<br/>
