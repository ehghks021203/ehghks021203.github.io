Oh is that what you heard?<br/>
Or are you making it worse?<br/>
Hanging on to a rope<br/>
You should probably let go of<br/>
<br/>
Someone's got you down again, so what?<br/>
Someone's plans are leaving you left out<br/>
Take a break from blowing it all up<br/>
'Cause I'm so tired<br/>
And now I'm saying<br/>
<br/>
Oh my God I'm caught in the middle<br/>
Of your existential committal<br/>
To see drama in every fit<br/>
Oh it's not so bad you just make it like that<br/>
Melodrama is what you've been craving<br/>
Marijuana is what you should take in<br/>
Maybe then you'd stop with the hating<br/>
It's not so bad you just make it like that<br/>
<br/>
I want you to be happy<br/>
But if youâ€™re not that's not on me, baby<br/>
Dial it back it's not so bad if<br/>
