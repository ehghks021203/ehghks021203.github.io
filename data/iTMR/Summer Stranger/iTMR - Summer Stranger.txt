Sweet like a cactus fruit on a summers day<br/>
(Ooh, that's what I say)<br/>
Blueberry muffins<br/>
2 glasses of champagne<br/>
(Ooh, that's what I say)<br/>
<br/>
Underneath the fig tree<br/>
You look at me<br/>
Your eyes are saying<br/>
Oh I know what this is and<br/>
I don't mean to rush<br/>
But I'm jumping in the deep end<br/>
<br/>
So it starts<br/>
Perfect summer stranger<br/>
This is us<br/>
Dancing with the danger<br>
My perfect summer stranger<br>
<br/>
Feels like a million dollars when it's yours<br>
(Ooh, makes you want more)<br/>
Natural order falls to place when we fall to the floor<br>
Mmm<br/>
(Ooh, baby one more)<br/>
<br/>
Underneath the fig tree<br/>
You look at me<br/>
Your eyes are saying<br/>
Oh I know what this is and<br/>
I don't mean to rush<br/>
But I'm jumping in the deep end<br/>
<br/>
So it starts<br/>
Perfect summer stranger<br/>
This is us<br/>
Dancing with the danger<br/>
My perfect summer stranger<br/>
<br/>
Starts<br/>
Perfect summer stranger<br/>
This is us<br/>
Dancing with the danger<br/>
My perfect summer stranger<br/>
