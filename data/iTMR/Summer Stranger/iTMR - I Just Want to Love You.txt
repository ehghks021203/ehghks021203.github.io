Yeah, alright!<br/>
Shoot me down with sugar cane cellophane<br/>
And all that's in between<br/>
Shoot me down with lethal aim baby girl<br/>
I won't tell a thing<br/>
<br/>
Oh how seasons change<br/>
Winds picking up<br/>
I better look out<br/>
<br/>
Cuz you said something<br/>
Then I said something<br/>
Now I have nothing<br/>
<br/>
I just want to love you<br/>
I just want to love you<br/>
(I just wanna love)<br/>
I just want to love you<br/>
<br/>
Hold my heart rip it apart honestly<br/>
It's not in my control<br/>
try to do what's good for you<br/>
Don't believe it say you didn't know<br/>
<br/>
Oh how seasons change<br/>
Winds picking up<br/>
I better look out<br/>
<br/>
Cuz you said something<br/>
Then I said something<br/>
Now I have nothing<br/>
<br/>
I just want To love you<br/>
I just want To love you<br/>
(I just wanna love)<br/>
I just want To love you<br/>

Yeah, alright!
