I've been trying to move a mountain<br/>
On my way to get to you<br/>
Skinny dipping in an ocean blue<br/>
<br/>
It's an uphill kind of battle<br/>
to make you see my point of view<br/>
Is it worth it I ain't got a clue<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you shoot yourself in the foot<br/>
Not to go to Vietnam<br/>
Sometimes if it's too good to be true<br/>
it means that your getting scammed<br/>
<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Say it isn't true, ooh<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Don't tell me I'm a fool, ooh<br/>
A fool for you<br/>
<br/>
I've had my premonitions<br/>
'Bout the ways that this could end<br/>
But as an optimist<br/>
I've always played my cards<br/>
<br/>
You've already lost<br/>
if you don't even play the game<br/>
Swing once, swing twice<br/>
You'll see it's nice<br/>
<br/>
And if sometimes you shoot yourself in the foot<br/>
Not to go to Vietnam<br/>
Sometimes if it's too good to be true<br/>
it means that you're getting scammed<br/>
<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Say it isn't true, ooh<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Don't tell me I'm a fool, ooh<br/>
A fool for you<br/>
